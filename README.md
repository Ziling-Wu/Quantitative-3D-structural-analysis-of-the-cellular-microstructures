# Quantitative-3D-structural-analysis-of-the-cellular-microstructures
This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication: Quantitative 3D structural analysis of the cellular microstructures of sea urchin spines (I): Methodology. Here we provide comprehensive quantitative description and analysis of the  natural cellular materials in 3D. In the first part 01_main_dataprocessing.m, network registration is performed based on binarized 3D volume; In the second part 02_main_dataAnalysis.m, feature extraction and data visulization are performed based on the registered network.  It provides free, open source tools for cellular materials geometry and shape analysis. Scripts need Matlab. Here we use sea urchin spine structure as a representative volume. Enjoy this structural analysis journey!
